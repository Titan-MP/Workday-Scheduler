This is a simple calendar application to show what we have learned in API and how to imtegrate them into our project. 

My motivation for completing this is to become a programmer, and application developer. I built this project becasue I want to learn how to develop applications and how they work and how to use queries,link pages and use local storage. It shows my skills to create a webpage for an employer. I learned how to push to git finally and to create CSS pages and HTML with JavaScript.Also to link sources to use as libraries. I also have larned 3rd party API integation. 

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by shields.io. You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

How to Contribute - Feel free to message me and contribute if you think of anything that may help!

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The Contributor Covenant is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
